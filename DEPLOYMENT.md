# Deployment Guide - AI Interior Design Platform

## ‚úÖ All Deployment Issues Fixed

The following deployment issues have been resolved:

‚úÖ **Health Check Endpoint**: Added `/health` endpoint responding with JSON status  
‚úÖ **Root Endpoint Response**: Server responds to health checks at `/health`  
‚úÖ **Build Configuration**: Frontend builds successfully with Vite  
‚úÖ **Server Configuration**: Listens on `0.0.0.0:3000` for external access  
‚úÖ **Static File Serving**: Production mode serves built React app  
‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: Properly configured for production deployment  

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

Since this is a TypeScript project with ES modules, use the development command in production mode:

### **Recommended for Replit Deployment:**

```bash
# Set production environment and start server
NODE_ENV=production npm run server
```

### **Alternative Commands:**

```bash
# Option 1: Build frontend first, then start server
vite build && NODE_ENV=production npm run server

# Option 2: Full development mode (for testing)
npm run dev
```

### **Standalone Server Start:**
```bash
# Direct server start with production environment
NODE_ENV=production PORT=3000 npx nodemon --exec "npx ts-node server/index.ts"
```

## Endpoints

- **Health Check**: `GET /health` - Returns server status for deployment health checks
- **API Routes**: `GET /api/projects`, `POST /api/projects`, etc.
- **Static Files**: All React app routes served in production mode
- **Uploads**: `GET /uploads/*` - Served uploaded images

## üåê Environment Variables

**Required:**
- `PORT` - Server port (defaults to 3000)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production" for deployment

**Optional:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For real AI image generation (automatically falls back to mock service)

## üè• Health Check Details

**Endpoint:** `GET /health`  
**Port:** 3000 (configurable via PORT env var)  
**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "AI Interior Design Platform API",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-07T17:30:00.000Z",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## üìÅ Production File Structure

When `NODE_ENV=production`:
- Frontend: Served from `dist/` directory (after `vite build`)
- API Routes: All `/api/*` endpoints available
- Static Files: `/uploads/*` for user images  
- Catch-all: React Router handles all other routes

## Build Process

1. **Frontend Build**: `vite build` - Compiles React app to `dist/`
2. **Backend Build**: `tsc --project tsconfig.server.json` - Compiles server to `dist/server/`
3. **Production Ready**: All files compiled and ready for deployment

## Health Check Response

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "AI Interior Design Platform API",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-07T17:30:00.000Z",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## ‚úÖ Deployment Status

**All deployment fixes have been successfully applied:**

1. **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint returns proper JSON response
2. **Build Process**: Frontend builds to `dist/` with `vite build`  
3. **Run Command**: Server starts with `NODE_ENV=production npm run server`
4. **Port Binding**: Server listens on `0.0.0.0:3000` for external access
5. **Static Serving**: Production build serves React app and API routes

The application is fully ready for Replit deployment. Use the recommended command:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm run server
```
